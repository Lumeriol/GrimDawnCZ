Thank goodness someone came! Those Slith, they attacked my caravan, and killed all my guards! {^n}{^n}I think the only reason they left me alive was so that they could have me fresh later. Those bastards!
I'm from Devil's Crossing, I can help you get back there!
Don't kid yourself, look at this blood, I'm not going to be able to walk out of here! Appreciate the thought, but it might be better to just end it quick.
You probably won't like this, but I can open a rift for you.
The last thing I want is my legs to stay on this side while the rest of me goes back! {^n}{^n}But you're not giving me any alternatives, are you? Send me off then.
I'm pretty sure this is safe. (Open Riftgate)
