Cult Activity
Kill Cultists
Captain Reave of the Black Legion is uncomfortable with the cult activity going on around an old tomb in the Asterkarn Mountains. Anything that attracts that much cult activity cannot be good for the Legion. He has tasked you with disrupting whatever the cult is up to. Travel to this Tomb of Korvaak in the Asterkarn Mountains and slay any Bloodsworn Priests and Bloodsworn Doomsayers you encounter. The tomb is somewhere in the wilderness, away from the road and along the mountain peaks.
