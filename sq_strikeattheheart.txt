The Outlaw Threat
A Life for an Eye
Slay Moneybags
Quade of the Rovers has one last favor to ask of you. Somewhere within Cronley's Hideout is one of Darius' most despicable lackeys, "Moneybags" Martin. Martin's been extorting helpless Rovers for months, earning his moniker. To top it off, he took Quade's eye during one such raid, spurring the Rover into his new life of combat and strife. Find Martin and end his life.
Slay "Moneybags" Martin

Return to Quade
