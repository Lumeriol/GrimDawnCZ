Bounty: Lord Executioner
Bounty
Deep within the Steps of Torment, beyond the ancient gates, there exists a chamber. Within that chamber, the fate of an entire nation was sealed for all eternity.{^n}{^n}And within that chamber, there dwells an ancient spirit known as Alkamos, the Lord Executioner. It is said that Alkamos was there when the curse was made manifest and there he remained, forever bound to the Steps of Torment.{^n}{^n}Should he ever escape, his vengeance would be devastating. Alkamos must be banished, that is the only solution.{^n}{^n}Anyone brave enough to see this through will be rewarded with some of our rarest scavenged materials.
