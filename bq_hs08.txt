Bounty: The Maneater
Bounty
Back when I was a younger man, I used to do a smuggling run that ran between Homestead and Burrwitch. We ran our operations out of a place we called Smuggler's Basin, out near Burrwitch.{^n}{^n}Last I've heard, the place was massacred by a dranghoul known as Gutworm. The beast feasted on the flesh of my comrades and scattered their bones.{^n}{^n}I want revenge. I want the Maneater dead. I've stowed away some valuable materials in my smuggling days. I will gladly share them with anyone that butchers that beast.

Slay Gutworm
