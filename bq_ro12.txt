Bounty: Mortallis
Bounty
Deep within the Steps of Torment, the Arkovian torture prison, there dwell several ruthless undead beings, chief amongst them Alkamos, the Lord Executioner. But Alkamos had many servants to carry out his decrees.{^n}{^n}Chief among them was Mortallis, a butcher of men who relished in the gruesome work of the Steps. Should he ever escape the Steps of Torment, Mortallis would bring his hunger for death to the innocents now ihnabiting the region. He must be destroyed.{^n}{^n}We have set aside some of their scavenged materials as reward for this task.
