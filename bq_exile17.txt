Bounty: Rampage
Bounty
To further my studies, I require an ancient Relic known to cause uncontrollable fury in its wielder, Rampage. Sadly, knowledge of its creation has long been lost.{^n}{^n}Should you rediscover information on its creation, bring it to a trusted blacksmith.{^n}{^n}Have them create the Relic, then bring it to me. It may be highly unstable, but that is just the catalyst I require.{^n}{^n}Do this for me and I shall reward you with some of my valuables.
