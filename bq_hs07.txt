Bounty: Stonewart Trolls
Bounty
Stonewart Trolls are a stubborn race of murderous half-beasts. Twice in recent history we've tried to eliminate them and twice they have returned. Now, with the world in shambles, the trolls have been spreading.{^n}{^n}They've already overrun Smuggler's Pass. We have to make sure that they never try heading north. Teach them fear of humanity, eliminate the Stonewart Trolls. We will gladly pay iron bits to see this done.
