Necropolis
Legion Retribution
Destroy Obelisks
Battlemage Moira of the Black Legion has tasked you with a dangerous mission that should cripple the Aetherials' ability to transform Cairn into whatever hell they came from. To her, it's not just about that though. This is a mission of payback, of revenge for lives taken. Travel to Deadman's Gulch and reopen the sealed off mine-shaft leading to the area called the Immolation. There, among the Aetherfire, you will find the Herald of Destruction, a giant Aetherial obelisk that has been terraforming the landscape. Destroy it, take revenge upon the Aetherials in the name of the Black Legion.

Slay the Herald of Destruction

Turn-in
You have slain the Herald of Destruction, thus crippling the Aetherials' effort to terraform Cairn and taking revenge upon the Aetherials for the lives lost on Moira's battalion. You should report back to her in Fort Ikon.
