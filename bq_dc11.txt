Bounty: The Blooddrinker
Bounty
It was no secret that Caspis was a blood-drinker and devout of Ch'thon. What is unfortunate is that he survived the Grim Dawn.{^n}{^n}Reports have come in of Caspis capturing travelers out in the Burrwitch Outskirts. It's unlikely that he's working alone, so there has to be a gathering of cultists somewhere in the area.{^n}{^n}Anyone that tracks down Caspis to his hideout and puts him down will be justly rewarded with some of our scavenged materials.
