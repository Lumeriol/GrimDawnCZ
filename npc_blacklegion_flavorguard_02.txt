Footman
As you were.
Farewell.
Ulgrim has requested your presence. Please see him immediately.
Can you open the gates?
Ulgrim has made it clear that nobody is to leave until he's been debriefed on recent events.
I'll speak to him.
I'll speak to him.
Stay on your guard. The enemies of humanity are all around us.
Can you open the gates?
I'm sorry. We are under strict orders to not open the gates as long as the Aetherial threat to the west still looms over us.
I see.
I'll be careful.
