Duncan
I don't blame you for your decision. Angrim is a fine blacksmith, the finest around to be sure. I'll do what I can for these people with what I got.
Farewell.
You're back! Do you have the Malleum Menhir?
I'm sorry, but the hammer stays with Angrim.
Ah, I...see...I guess this is good bye then. If you'll excuse me, I have to tend to the forge.
Farewell.
I'm almost finished here. I'll see you in Devil's Crossing.
See you there.
You're back! Do you have the Malleum Menhir?
I persuaded Angrim to part with it. Here you go.
I'm impressed. Angrim is a tough man to convince of anything, but I'm glad it did not have to come to blows. Thank you, I will do much good with this.
So will you join me in Devil's Crossing?
Yes, of course. First I must complete my work here. Now that I have my master's forging hammer, I will be able to provide these people with quality equipment.{^n}{^n}I'll see you in Devil's Crossing when I'm finished, I promise.
See you there.
I had the hammer, but I misplaced it.
What?! Go back out there and find it. That hammer is invaluable!
I'm on it.
You're back! Do you have the Malleum Menhir?
I was forced to kill Angrim for it, but here it is.
I wish it hadn't come to this. That is a terrible price to pay for this sacred relic. But the good of us all outweighs the life of one.{^n}{^n}I will have to toil away that much harder to make sure that Angrim's life was not taken in vain.

So? Did you speak to Angrim?
Where is he again?
My master left the camp earlier today, heading northeast. He can't be far.


I will find him.
What is the Malleum Menhir?
It is an ancient forging hammer passed down through generations of blacksmiths. It is now in the hands of my master, Angrim, but I feel that the time has come for it to be passed on to younger hands.
Where is Angrim again?

I see.
Why do you feel the hammer should go to you?
My master is an expert blacksmith, don't get me wrong. The weapons he creates are of the finest quality, but he is reluctant to experiment with arcane forging techniques. In that, I am his superior and he knows it.{^n}{^n}More importantly though, I wish to help people while my master wishes only to prepare soldiers for the battle against the Aetherials. It's a noble goal, but humanity will not thrive if just our soldiers survive.
Where is Angrim again?

I understand.
I'm still searching.
Hello, traveler. If you find yourself going about these parts, I was wondering if you'd help us locate someone. I'm a bit tied up with the forge here.
Someone disappeared?
My master, Angrim, left our camp earlier today. He's intent on finding a group of survivors that he considers "worthy" of our smithing talents. We don't exactly see eye to eye on the matter of who we should be helping.{^n}{^n}Angrim wants to field an army and take the fight to the Aetherials. I'd rather save as many as I can, whether they can fight or not. I want to help these people, but without my master's forging hammer, the sacred Malleum Menhir, I won't be able to make anything worth a damn.
A blacksmith? We could use you in Devil's Crossing.
If you get Malleum Menhir back, I will gladly join you in Devil's Crossing, after I use it to help out around here.{^n}{^n}Please seek out my master and get Malleum Menhir back. I saw him heading out to the northeast. He couldn't have gotten far.
I will find Angrim.
I'm sorry, I cannot help you.

I see.
What are you doing out here?
Arming these people against the dangers of Cairn. Doing the best I can with what I've got.
What did you need help with?
Goodbye.
