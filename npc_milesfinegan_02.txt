Myles Finegan
Are you enjoying my quarters?
You tricked me!
Deception was a necessary evil so that, together, we could better serve. You have been most helpful and you've earned this prize. The bandits don't really come near my lair anymore, so you will have the honor of being my latest sacrifice.
You are insane!
Maga'Thel, lord of the void, hear your servant's call. Bless your servant's flesh with your presence. Let blood flow freely this day!
I will stop you!
I'm going to kill you!

Deceitful bastard! Die!
