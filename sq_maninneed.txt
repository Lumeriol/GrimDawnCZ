Get dynamite
You encountered a lone traveler, Myles Finegan, outside of a collapsed cave entrance in the Broken Hills, near the Tower of Exile. As this was his only safe haven, he implored you to help him acquire some dynamite from the bandits camped out in Old Arkovia so that he can clear the way into his hideout and retrieve his belongings.

Kill Myles
