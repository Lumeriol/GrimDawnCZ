Jebediah
Thank you... for everything.
You're welcome.
I heard about what you've done. Cronley was a terrifying man. I can't imagine facing him.
And now you'll never have to.
What have you done?! When Silas doesn't report back, we're as good as dead. I need to get out of here...
I'm going after his gang next. Farewell.
You attacked Silas? Are you mad?! The rest of his gang will hang us for this!
Their extortion is at an end.
Thank you for your assistance. With the waters as dangerous as they are these days and spirits roaming the ruins of Arkovia, I'm not sure we would have managed without you.
You're welcome. Take care.
I hear you're going to help us with our tribute. Thank you, stranger. If only there were more of you out in this forsaken world.
I do my share.
I don't have anything to give you. If you want to work, go talk to the overseer. If not, you'd best just clear out of here.
Farewell.
