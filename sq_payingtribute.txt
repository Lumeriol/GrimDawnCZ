Old Arkovia
Paying Tributes
Deliver item or kill bandit
Alicia from New Harbor in Old Arkovia. Her village is being extorted by the nearby bandits and the quota for their deliveries keeps increasing. With her people spread thin trying to collect enough fish for the tribute, they have fallen behind on their scrap collecting. If they do not deliver enough scrap to Silas, their overseer, he will undoubtedly execute someone. Alicia was very clear that no harm should come to Silas as she fears retribution. She has asked you to collect the missing scrap in the village's stead. The bandits have a stronghold on the Four Hills nearby that should have scrap.
