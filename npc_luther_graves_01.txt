Thank heavens someone came! Those Slith, they attacked my caravan and stole the purified salt I was transporting. If it wasn't for my trusty rifle, I'd probably be dead. I fear I won't be able to make it back on foot... but Devil's Crossing needs that salt!
I'll get the salt, but I'm making sure you get back safely. (Open Portal)
I'll get the salt, but no one is going to miss you! (Attack Him)
Don't worry about me stranger, I'm fine. What's important is that Purified Salt. The Slith came in and made off with it, among other things. For the life of me, can't figure out what they'd want with it, but you can probably find it in their camps. Bring it back to Alicia in Devil's Crossing!
Thanks, I'll keep an eye out.
Stuck here on the Burrwitch Road... in the middle of Wightmire... great.
Take care.
I'll get the salt, but no one is going to miss you! (Attack Him)
