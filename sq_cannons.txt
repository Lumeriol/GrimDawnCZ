Recover Cannons
Weapons Master Borrov of the Black Legion is distraught by the loss of several cannons that the Legion was forced to abandon in an area northeast of Homestead known as the Conflagration. When you asked about it, he warned you that their recovery is the equivalent of suicide as the area burns with aetherfire.
