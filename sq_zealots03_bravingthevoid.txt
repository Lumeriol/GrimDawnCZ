Kymon's Chosen
Braving the Void
Kill Boss
Father Kymon is impressed with your recent actions against the Cult of Ch'thon, but before you are allowed to receive Empyrion's will from the Blessed Father himself, you must first prove your iron will through a trial-by-fire. Find a chaos rift somewhere in the Blood Grove and enter it. Once there, seek out its master, a Chthonian beast known as Bane'Gargoth, and destroy it.
Slay Bane'Gargoth

Turn-in
You have slain Bane'Gargoth and passed the Chosen's challenge. Speak to Brother Elluvius back at Sorrow's Bastion of your success.
Return to Brother Elluvius
