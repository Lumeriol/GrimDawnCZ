Bounty: Ballior
Bounty
Ballior was once a joyful older man who managed a bakery in Burrwitch. Sadly, he fell when the Aetherials attacked.{^n}{^n}I dread to think of what the Aetherials had done to his remains when they dragged him into a cellar. It would ease my heart to know that he is at peace.{^n}{^n}I do not have much to offer, but I've set aside some materials for anyone that puts Ballior to rest.
