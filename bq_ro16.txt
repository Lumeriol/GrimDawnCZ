Bounty: Skeletal Monstrosities
Bounty
Skeletal golems are an abomination, a joining of tortured souls no longer stable enough to exist as individuals. This joining also makes them incredibly powerful and unstable.{^n}{^n}Should one ever escape from the ruins below Arkovia, it would wreck havoc across the land. We would rather this never be allowed to happen.{^n}{^n}Anyone that eliminates these tortured beings will be justly rewarded with some of our scavenged materials.
