Bounty: Harbinger of Chaos
Bounty
The Harbinger of Chaos, Shar'Zul is here, on Cairn. I can sense his tainted presence. The Bastion of Chaos, the massive riftgate that tore open near the Necropolis, is his domain.{^n}{^n}Now, I would not ask this of you if I thought you incapable, but I cannot stress the dangers of the ordeals ahead. The Harbinger's very presence is a danger to us all. He must be eliminated if Cairn is to survive, or all is lost.{^n}{^n}Travel into the Bastion of Chaos and dethrone its tyrant. Survive the encounter and I'll even reward you with something from my most treasured collection.

Slay Shar'Zul
