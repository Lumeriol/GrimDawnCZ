Come back later, still setting up shop.
Farewell.
My Josephine has informed me that you've returned the money you stole. I appreciate that.

Perhaps we can leave this unfortunate incident behind us, eh?
I'd like nothing more.

Seems our roads cross again. Glad to see you've survived the wilderness.
Same to you.
Say, I've gathered up quite a few interestings things while traveling out there. Don't suppose you'd be interested in buying something?

Only the best deals for a friend.
Let's take a look.
Oh, it's you. Hoped the animals had gotten you by now.
Um, well I survived.
Look, I'm not going to pretend like you didn't rob us out there, but I've got goods for sale and we need the bits.

So either take a look at what I have for sale or get out of my face. And don't try anything funny, the Legion is keeping a tight watch on this place.
Alright, let's see what you have.
Not interested.
Greetings, stranger. Was just about to open up the shop. Interested in seeing what I've got?
Let's take a look.
