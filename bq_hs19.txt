Bounty: Queen Ravna
Bounty
The Dermapteran Queen Ravna has been allowed to thrive for far too long. Her brood has spread rampantly throughout our lands, unimpeded by even the Aetherials.{^n}{^n}Sooner or later, the Dermapterans will devour everything that's left in the fields, and then they will turn their attention upon Homestead. By that point, their numbers will wash over us like a flood of locusts.{^n}{^n}We must not allow that to happen. Queen Ravna must die. As compensation for this daring task, we have set aside some scavenged materials.

Slay the Dermapteran Queen
