Chef Brackham
With the Dermapteran threat dealt with, Captain Somer has requisitioned some supplies to get a kitchen up and running.{^n}{^n}Now that we have food coming in from the fields you've reclaimed, we can finally start living off of more than scraps.
I could use a meal.
Of course. Enjoy.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but I can't offer any more.{^n}{^n}The Black Legion has us on strict rations.
Alright.
What about food for the people of Devil's Crossing?
You'll have to take that up with Douglass.
Very well.
Farewell.
Sorry, still getting the kitchen ready for business.{^n}{^n}Please come back later.
Farewell.
