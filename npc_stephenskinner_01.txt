I would like to thank you for talking me out of committing the biggest mistake of my life. We were struggling to survive and I got desparate. My family deserves better. Thank you for showing me that hope still remains in this bleak world.{^n}{^n}I would like you to have this. It's a small token of our appreciation. I hope it serves you well.
Thank you. Take care.
Thank you for bringing my family here. We could not ask for more given the times. We will do out best to contribute.
Glad to hear it.
Stand back. I'm burning this shack down. My family does not need to suffer any longer in this horrible world.
Is your family in there? Are you insane?!
Stay out of this. It's for the best.
You can't do this!
I have to! Day after day, we struggled out here, surrounded by bandits and foul beasts. This is no place to raise a family.
You can't give up now.
Because things will get better? Hah! I've seen only ever seen them get worse and worse. This ends now.
No! Don't do it!
You're right, it's not. Devil's Crossing is safe though. Join me there.

You're right. Go ahead.
Look, things are bad, but we can't lose hope.
What hope is there left? Good people are dying and the world is overrun with monstrosities we used to spook our children with. I will not have my family suffer any longer.
Others have managed to survive. You can too.
We've tried...we're tried for too long. Frankly, I'm tired of trying. This ends now.
Wait, don't!
I come from Devil's Crossing. It's safe there.
Safe? What's safe anymore. We were safe out here once too. Look at this place now.
We defend it. There is shelter and drinking water. Please, join us.
Perhaps this is the fresh start we needed. I really hope you speak the truth. Alright, take us there.
I'll see you and your family there. (Open Riftgate)
You're right. Go ahead.
Fine. Go ahead.
Nope. Not dealing with crazy.
