The ancients once created wondrous relics of incredible power. Sadly, much of this knowledge is now lost.{^n}{^n}I require a Glacier Relic to continue my research. Should you rediscover information on its creation, bring it to a trusted blacksmith.{^n}{^n}Have them create the Relic, then bring it to me. Its icy core will help stabilize my experiments.{^n}{^n}Do this for me and I shall reward you with some of my valuables.
