The Search for Food
Culling the Swarm
Kill Viziers + Open Door
Douglass was impressed with how you handled the Dermapterans out in the Rotting Croplands. He is confident in your abilities and believes you can put a stop to the Dermapterans for good. Dermapteran hives are cyclical. Every seven years or so, they birth a new queen, which promptly proliferates their numbers. In the past, the farmers would rally and exterminate the queen while she was still young. But after the Grim Dawn, the Dermapterans were allowed to thrive, and now their queen is a massive creature that spawns new Dermapterans by the dozen every day.

She has to be destroyed, otherwise the Dermapterans will eventually run out of food and attack Homestead in force. The queen is guarded by two of her Grand Viziers. You will not be able to even enter her chamber without their pheromone glands. Seek out the Royal Hive somewhere out in the Rotting Croplands, to the west of Homestead and open the queen's chamber.
