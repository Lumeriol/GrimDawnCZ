Thank you for taking mercy on us. This place...it's amazing.
What happened to you and Julius?
I was a companion in Burrwitch, down at the Lusty Mare near the docks. Don't give me that look, it was a respected establishment. Frankly, working there saved my life. You can always count on a few eager men to defend a helpless gal. No idea if any of them survived the attack, I wasn't about to check. I put Burrwitch behind me as fast as I could. Course that was a dumb move. Not a mile out of Burrwitch, I got myself cornered by a band of grobles. It was Julius who saved me that time. To be honest, I took advantage of that man. Put myself before him that night and clung onto him since for survival. But he's been good to me, and I want to do right by him.{^n}{^n}The little roadside scheme was my idea. Swindling a few honest souls so that we could survive was nothing I was proud of, but the alternative was going to the bandits. Julius is no hardened criminal, and I don't want to imagine what they do to women. Our chance meeting with you was the best thing that's happened to us in months. Thank you again.
You can earn an honest living here. Just do your share.
Stay out of trouble.
You poor stupid thing. Gotta say, you're making me feel a little guilty. It's all a sham, hon. You got swindled. We do what we gotta do out here, and it sure beats aiming a gun at every traveler that crosses us.{^n}{^n}Now get going before you give away our little scheme.
You don't have to live like this. (Tell her about the prison)
A safe place? I forget what that even means. And you'd really take us in, even after what we pulled?
You did what you had to. You deserve a second chance.
I...I don't know what to say. I...thank you.
See you in Devil's Crossing. (Open Riftgate)
You deceitful wench. You're both as good as dead!
Curse my big mouth. Guess it's your money and your life, hon.
Time to die, thief!
Please do something! He's going to kill me!
I'll handle this.
What do I care?
