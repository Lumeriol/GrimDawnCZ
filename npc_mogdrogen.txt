Have you come to pay your respects, mortal?

Farewell.
Come to pay your respects?
May I ask some questions?
You may ask.
Who or what are you?
I am the Lord of Beasts, protector of nature, and guardian of the Rhowari.{^n}{^n}Your mortal kind calls me Mogdrogen.
A god? Shouldn't you be protecting Cairn?
A mere fragment of my presence, an avatar. But more than enough to squash you like the insignificant insect you are.{^n}{^n}So watch your tone with me, mortal.
Nobody talks to me that way.
You would threaten a Primordial Being? One who was old when this world was but a molten orb?{^n}{^n}Surely your mortal struggles have not brought you before me seeking your own destruction?
Alright then, I'll be going.
God or not, you die! (Misguidedly Attack)
I have another question.
Alright then, I'll be going.
I have another question.
I...see.

I have another question.
Thank you.


I have another question.
Thank you.


I have another question.
Thank you.


I have another question.
Thank you.
Nevermind.
Farewell.
You have done the Rhowari a great justice this day, mortal. For this, I thank you.
Is this your shrine?
The shrine was created in my honor, yes. It is one of many, though none suffered the corrupting presence of Ch'thon as this one.{^n}{^n}Your valor shall not go without reward.

Thank you.
