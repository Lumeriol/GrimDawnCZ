Order of Death's Vigil
A Catalyst
Collect Aetherial Essence
The ritual to bring back a being as powerful as Malkadarr will require a potent source of arcane energies. Aetherials are the Aether itself, manifested within our realm. In a fiery conflagration at the Stonerend Quarry to the northeast of Blood Grove, near Fort Haron, there is a powerful Aetherial sorceress known as Noveria Stormfire. Using necromantic power bestowed upon you by the Order of Death's Vigil, capture her essence and bring it back to Master Varuuk at Sorrow's Bastion.
