Thank... you...
Rest in peace.
Please... save Oscar and Judith...
Where are they again?
Cronley's thugs took them to his hideout. Please... hurry...
I will go there at once.
I will.
You... this is all... your fault...
How did this happen?
Someone above... saw you kill Silas. They came... shortly... after you left.{^n}{^n}Please... they took... the children to Cronley's Hideout. Save them. Find them... a good home...
I will.
I'm sorry. I caused enough harm.
I was only trying to help.
