The Outlaw Threat
An Old Threat
Remove the Arms
The bandits roaming Old Arkovia are under the command of one Darius Cronley, a former inmate at the Devil's Crossing prison, before the chaos caused by the Grim Dawn provided him with an opportunity to escape. He now plans to retake the prison for himself and his convicts turned bandits, with little regard for its inhabitants. Darius and his group must be eradicated if Devil's Crossing is to survive. You must venture out to Old Arkovia and shatter Darius' operation. The outlaws built themselves a makeshift stronghold on top of the Four Hills in Old Arkovia.{^n}{^n}Begin by killing Darius' lieutenants, whom you will recognize by their odd nicknames. They will likely be atop the Four Hills. Then, move on to Darius himself. Darius is rarely seen outside the mines underneath Four Hills. Leave them crippled and broken, just as they intended for the people of Devil's Crossing.


Kill Darius' Lieutenants

Return to Mornay
The bandits are scattered and leaderless. They should no longer pose a threat for the defenders of Devil's Crossing. Report back to Mornay in Devil's Crossing.
