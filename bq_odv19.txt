Bounty: Eternal Suffering
Bounty
The Arkovian curse had many curious side-effects on the afflicted, but none have proven to be dangerous until now.{^n}{^n}Within the Steps of Torment, out in the Broken Hills, there dwells a skeletal abomination known as Ilgorr the Eternal. Formed from a fusion of countless Arkovian souls and bodies, Ilgorr has developed necrotic powers that are truly terrifying to behold.{^n}{^n}We must not allow such an abomination to exist. Travel into the Steps of Torment and eliminate Ilgorr. The Order shall provide enchantments to aid in the journey.{^n}{^n}Wealth from within our rarest collection shall be at your disposal should you survive.
