Bounty: Ancient Heart
Bounty
One of our scouts has been poisoned by one of Cronley's men while out on patrol. It appears to be a deadly concotion that causes necrosis and paralysis of the flesh.{^n}{^n}Eva believes she may have a cure, but she will require an Ancient Heart to craft the tonic. She will gladly offer up a Blood of Ch'thon for trade.
