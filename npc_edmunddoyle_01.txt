Edmund "Shanks" Doyle
You'll pay for this...{^n}{^n}*Cough*{^n}{^n}Darius wants this prison and when he finds out what you've done...{^n}{^n}*Edmund spits up blood*{^n}{^n}You'll wish I shanked you dead.
Rest in peace, scum.
Me and the boys would like to thank you for the fine work y'all have done repairing that bridge. Saved us a load of trouble trying to get across otherwise.
You're going to have to get through me first.
How heroic. Gonna give your head to Bourbon before I slit his throat.
Try me.
Fine last words.
Not as fine as your screams will be when I cut you open from head to toe.
Come on then!
Going to put your head on a spike as a reminder to your lackeys not to come back.
I'm gonna gut you like a pig!
Bring it on!
