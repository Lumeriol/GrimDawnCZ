Bounty: Phabius
Bounty
Phabius Crowsworth is one of the locals, but sadly he was staying with family in Burrwitch when the Grim Dawn took place.{^n}{^n}Based on the tales I've heard about what happened in the village, I fear the worst. Please, if Phabius has been turned into one of those undead monsters, I wish that he be put to rest.{^n}{^n}I will gladly share my scavenged supplies in exchange for peace of mind.



Slay Phabius
