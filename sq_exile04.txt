The Exile
Black Heart of the Void
Obsidian Shard
Anasteria is interested in the powers of the void, particularly where they draw their strength. To achieve this, she requires a Pulsating Obsidian Shard from a powerful fiend. Enter the Bastion of Chaos through a rift in the Necropolis and break the chthonian seal. Once inside, slay the creature known as Galar'Bargok, collect its Obsidian Shard and deliver it to Anasteria at the Fort Ikon Prison.
