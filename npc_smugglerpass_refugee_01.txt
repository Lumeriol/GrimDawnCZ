I survived two campaigns in the Northlands only to be driven off my hard won lands by half-troll scum. Now in the time of the empire's greatest need, I'm a used up old man with one eye and limp. What a shame that I'm alive while so many brave veterans fell to see the rest of us this far. All the more so that I've beheld this man Ulgrim, seemingly a peer in age but who yet fights with a ferocity I could not match in my prime. His speed and skill is like nothing I've witnessed, even in all my years on the battlefield.

I hope you can help these people but, if not, I thank you for trying. Maybe it's best that my journey ends here; I'm just a burden now to those who are still fit to carry on the fight.
Don't give up yet.
