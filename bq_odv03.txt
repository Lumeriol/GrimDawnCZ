Bounty: Blade Maidens
Bounty
Kymon's Chosen cannot be reasoned with. They send their flame-wielding Blade Maidens after our people to butcher them like animals.{^n}{^n}We will not stand for this. Slaughter any Blade Maidens you come across. Perhaps that will send a message to the Chosen and their false prophet. And besides, they will serve as excellent minions.{^n}{^n}Iron bits for every slain Blade Maiden.

Slay Kymon's Blade Maidens
