Elara
Our poor Kalista...in peace at last.
Farewell.
Hello, traveler.{^n}{^n}We don't get many visitors out here. Not with the Dermapterans running wild.
A Chthonian almost tricked me into releasing it here.
Oh no, you must mean Kalista.{^n}{^n}The girl is devil spawn, a curse upon our family. Shortly after she was born, her eyes would glow red and she could speak, but not in any human tongue.{^n}{^n}Tarvic could not bring himself to end her life, so we left her in a nearby tomb and sealed the entrance shut. {^n}{^n}If you have spoken to her, then she must have broken free!
Do not fear. I have banished the Chthonian for good.
I thank you. Kalista was a terror we could not face.{^n}{^n}You've done what we could not bring ourselves to do.
You are safe from the Chthonian now.
That is a horrible fate to place upon anyone.
Perhaps you are right, but she terrified us.{^n}{^n}We would awaken to find her bed filled with blood. Random objects would spontaneously burst into flame.{^n}{^n}We did what we had to in order to protect ourselves from the creature.
I will finish what you could not.
That is despicable, but I destroyed your demon.
Don't worry. I will banish the creature.
How do you survive out here?
We try to stay out of sight. If anything dangerous gets too close, we put out the campfire and hide.{^n}{^n}We plan to leave this place soon though and you should too...
Farewell.
Farewell.
