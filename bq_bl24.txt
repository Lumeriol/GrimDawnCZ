Bounty: Lord Executioner
Bounty
The Legion requests assistance with a priority target.{^n}{^n}Far to the south, within the Broken Hills, there is a forgotten ruin known as the Steps of Torment. It appears to be the epicenter of all undead activity within Arkovia. At the bottom of this accursed place, there dwells a corrupt spirit known as Alkamos. If he were somehow destroyed and the tower cleansed, then the Legion could study the ruins and excavate them for artifacts. Such a valuable resource cannot be underestimated.{^n}{^n}The Legion is willing to share some of its rare materials with anyone that manages to accomplish this impossible task.
