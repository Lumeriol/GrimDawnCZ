You get that bastard Isaiah for me, that son of a slith.
I will.
You there! Hear a dying man out, will ya?
What happened to you?
Backstabbed by my partner, only man I thought I could trust on this forsaken hellhole. We were traveling, cart full of scrap we'd salvaged from some run-down homes, when I guess the bastard decided that splitting the profits 50/50 just wasn't gonna cut it. He jumped me in the middle of the night and stabbed me right in the gut. Made off with all the loot and left me to die out here.{^n}{^n}If you ever run into a man in a patchwork green jacket going by the name Isaiah, you cut him down for me. Will ya? Don't suppose he got too far down the road, pushing the cart by himself.
I will avenge you.
I'm not getting involved in this.
I don't want to hear it.
