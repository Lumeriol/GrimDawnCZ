The Trials of Homestead
Reaping What You Sow
Kill Cultist Leader
Captain Somer is determined to put an end to cultist activity. Her scouts have uncovered the identity of their leader in the region, one by the name Karroz, the Sigil of Ch'thon. He is hiding out somewhere deep in cultist territory, north of Sorrow's Bastion. The captain wishes him assassinated so that the cultist chain of command is crippled.
Slay Karroz, Sigil of Ch'thon
