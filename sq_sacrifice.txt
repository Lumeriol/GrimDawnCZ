Devil's Crossing
A Sacrifice
Find Stash
You found a poor soul beyond rescue out in Wightmire. Isaac, who was in the process of being sacrificed by some cultists, was too far gone when you reached him. With his last breath, he informed you of a valuable stash he hid away out in the swamp. If you follow the river outside the cabin where you found Isaac down to the river delta, you will find his stash hidden along the shore. He said to look for a loose tree stump.
