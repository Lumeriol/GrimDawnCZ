Bounty
The work of the Chosen is never finished.{^n}{^n}We have made discovery of an underground system of tunnels underneath Old Arkovia known as the Undercity. It is a cursed place filled with undying abominations.{^n}{^n}On its lowest level, there dwells the undying vessel of a corrupt Arkovian soul, Kilrian. This fiend's very existence corrupts the land. Gather its shattered spirit and bring it here so that it can be cleansed by Empyrion's flame and the land can be allowed to heal.{^n}{^n}Wealth from within our rarest collection shall be at your disposal should you survive this ordeal. Travel with Kymon's blessing.
