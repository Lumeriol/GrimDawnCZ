The Outlaw Threat
The Warrior Among Rovers
Find Rovers
Quade and his group are unlike most Rovers. Rather than stand by and watch as the outlaws destroyed their lives, they instead took up arms and marched against the enemy. It was Quade's group that rescued Mornay during his last venture into Old Arkovia. It would be wise to speak with Quade if you are to attack the outlaws at their strongest. His camp should be near the Four Hills in Old Arkovia.
