Old Arkovia
Troll Rampage
Slay Troll
Hiram of the Rovers was severely injured when a rogue troll came down from the mountains and began rampaging about Old Arkovia. While the Rover camp may be separated from the beast by the barricade the outlaws put up, Hiram is still concerned for the safety of his people and implored you to put down the troll before it causes any more harm. You should be able to find Gulgoth, the Rampaging down the road from the Rover camp in Old Arkovia, likely wreaking havoc.
