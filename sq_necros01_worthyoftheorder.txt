One of the groups most prominent members, Master Malkadarr, was recently slain by the Cult out in the Blood Grove. Malkadarr's duties are not yet concluded. You are to search the cult's camps in the Blood Grove and retrieve the fallen necromancer's remains. Bring them back to Master Varuuk at Sorrow's Bastion.
