Myla Finegan
You are not the one I seek.
Alright then.
I must apologize for the ruse, but alas, I cannot travel very far from my tomb.{^n}{^n}You may die knowing that you've served me well.
You tricked me!
Deception was a necessity. Would you have sacrificed yourself willingly knowing my true intentions?{^n}{^n}I merely do what I must to survive. Now hush and die peacefully. This will all be over soon.
I'm not just going to lie down and die!
Not if I kill you first! (Attack)
Deceitful bitch! Die!
I have haunted this forest for centuries, sapping unsuspecting fools such as yourself of their precious vitality.{^n}{^n}What hope do you have against me?
I can still try! (Attack)
Only one way to find out. (Attack)
You are not the one I seek.
Alright then.
