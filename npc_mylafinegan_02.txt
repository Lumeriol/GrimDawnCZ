Myla Finegan
You are not the one I seek.
Alright then.
I must apologize for the ruse, but alas, I cannot travel very far from my tomb.{^n}{^n}You may die knowing that I will savor you as I drain the life from your breathe.
You tricked me!
Deception was a necessity. Would you have sacrificed yourself willingly knowing my true intentions?{^n}{^n}I merely do what I must to survive. Now hush and die peacefully. This will all be over soon.
I'm not just going to lie down and die!
Not if I kill you first! (Attack)
Deceitful wretch! You've picked the wrong prey this time!
I have haunted this forest for centuries, sapping unsuspecting fools such as yourself of their precious vitality. My cave has been sealed off time and again but, somehow, it is always uncovered again thanks to naive dupes like yourself or the greedy prospectors who visited me last.{^n}{^n}What hope do you have against me?
I can still try! (Attack)
Only one way to find out. (Attack)
You are not the one I seek.
Alright then.
