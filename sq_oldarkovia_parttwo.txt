Old Arkovia
Descent into Torment
Slay Boss
Kalderos has instructed you to descend into the Steps of Torment, the ruined remants of Arkovia's dark history. Once inside, you must seek out the Grand Priest Zarthuzellan, who resides on the third floor. When you have destroyed the corrupted priest, the way will be clear to the doors sealing off the deepest pits of the Steps of Torment. The Steps of Torment are located deep within the Broken Hills.
