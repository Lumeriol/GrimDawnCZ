Bounty: Romanov
Bounty
Romanov was a brutal man with more muscle than brains back before the Grim Dawn.{^n}{^n}Now rumor is that he's accepted Cronley's Aether crystals to become even stronger. If such a beast of a man ever decides to attack Devil's Crossing, he could cause some serious harm.{^n}{^n}Anyone that tracks down Romanov and puts him down will be justly rewarded with some of our scavenged materials.



Slay "The Bruiser" Romanov

Turn In
You have completed the task for Devil's Crossing and should return to the Bounty Table for your reward.
