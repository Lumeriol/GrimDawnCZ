Bounty: Voldrak
Bounty
Smuggler's Pass was once a popular route taken by our people when traveling north. It is now overrun with the Mistborn trolls, but the greatest danger comes from an oversized brute they keep within the cave known as Voldrak.{^n}{^n}Voldrak is huge, even by troll standards, and he guards the way through. If Smuggler's Pass is ever to be safe again, Voldrak must be slain.{^n}{^n}We will gladly spare some of our scavenged materials to see this through.

Slay Voldrak
