I'll sleep easier knowing that psychopath is eating dirt. I may not be a good man but I have limits and the things that Cronley did... it's enough to turn your stomach.
That it was.
Look, I didn't know what I was getting into with Cronley, until he had his hooks in me. Sure, I knew Cronley's reputation but I figured, hey, I done some bad work myself. I just didn't count on how deep his darkness went.{^n}{^n}First I thought... this is a man with some vision, a leader who can cut a cushy life for us here by living fat off the spoils of rovers and the toil of lesser folk. Things just kept getting more twisted though. Cronley's closest men became fanatics, following his every command no matter how depraved or bizarre. They stuck these damned green crystals in their flesh and became freakishly strong. The things he ordered done to folk... sometimes just for sport, I couldn't take it no more.{^n}{^n}He made brutal examples of people who defected in the past but, I figured out a way. You see, I was captured. I didn't really defect. He'll see that... right?
Interesting...
