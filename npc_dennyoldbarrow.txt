Denny Oldbarrow
You're quickly becoming a legend around here.
Farewell.
Hello stranger. We don't get many visitors out here anymore. Where do you hail from?
I come from Devil's Crossing.
Oh, I heard that place got hit pretty hard, there and Burrwitch.

Seems you survived though.
There are others, but we're running low on food.
Wish I could help, but we're not doing so hot on supplies ourselves.

Talk to my father. Maybe he'll figure something out.
I will.
Burrwitch is in pretty bad shape.
It seems anywhere you go these days there's nothing but ruins and suffering.

I can't imagine the world ever recovering from this.
We'll have to try.
It wasn't easy, I can tell you that.
None of your business.
I'd rather not say.
