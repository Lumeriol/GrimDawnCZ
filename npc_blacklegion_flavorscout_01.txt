I suggest you turn back, traveler. The Blood Grove is teeming with the Cult of Ch'thon, and worse.{^n}{^n}I've watched as a rift tore itself open before our eyes and sucked in several men. It vanished just as quickly.{^n}{^n}If you feel the air tingling with strange energy, back away immediately.
What about the other scouts?
Lost, taken by the cult.{^n}{^n}The lucky ones died during the fighting, the rest...


I'm sorry.
What else is out there?
Blackmane manticores are running wild now that there isn't anyone around to keep them away from the roads.{^n}{^n}Then there's the Order of Death's Vigil and the Kymon's Chosen. Those two groups of fanatics have been at each other's throats for weeks.{^n}{^n}I hope you weren't planning on heading north to Fort Ikon. Darkvale has been completely overrun by the Bloodsworn.


Thanks for the info.
What was beyond the rift?
The rifts seem to be highly unstable. The only scouts that went through did not do so willingly, and we never saw them again.


Only one way to find out.
They sound dangerous.
I'll be careful.
