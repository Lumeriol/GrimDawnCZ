I'm... I'm sorry, I misjudged you. You do so much to keep us all safe.
I take it these are your children?
No, my children are dead. I left them alone at home while I went off to... visit our neighbor. Captain John found me hiding in the neighbor's cellar like a coward. What kind of mad gods would leave the innocent to be slaughtered while wretches like me are spared? Captain John brought me here, he gave me these children, Jane and Alex, to look after. Caring for them is the only thing that keeps me going.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Just doing my part.
You're that one that was possessed! You stay away from me and the children or I'll scream and Captain John will come deal with you as he should have from the start!
Calm down lady; I don't mean you any harm. I just wanted to talk.
Please...just leave me alone and stay away from the children.
As you say.
Very well.
