Bounty: Manticore Eye
Bounty
This may sound selfish, but I don't much care. Manticores tore my sister apart when I was a child.{^n}{^n}I swore when I was old enough to carry a gun that I'd go out there and gun down as many as I can, but now you can't step five feet outside Homestead without running into something far worse than a manticore.{^n}{^n}Please, to anyone that is braver than I, go out there and slay the manticores. Bring me one of their eyes as proof and I will gladly share some of my scavenged materials.

Collect Manticore Eye
Deliver the Manticore Eye to the Homestead Bounty Table
