Ulgrim
Move along, my blades hunger for troll blood, but they'll settle for you.
Alright, I'm going.
So, how doomed are we?
I've secured the way via riftgate.
Ugh, that wretched thing again? Nearly lost my breakfast the last time you took me through one of those.

Well, no sense in complaining, these people won't last much longer out here.
I'll see you all in Homestead. (Open Riftgate)
A portal? Only ever seen the Aetherials using those.

I really hope you know what you're doing.
I'll see you all in Homestead. (Open Riftgate)
I hope your journey to Homestead goes well.
Where should I go again?
The old route through the mines is blocked off, courtesy of the Aetherials. You will need to enter the Mountain Deeps nearby and find a way through onto the Prospector's Trail. If you follow it north, you will eventually find Homestead. It's hard to miss.
Alright, I'll be off then.
I'll get you to safety soon.
Well if it isn't my best friend from Devil's Crossing. I had a feeling you'd be making your way through here.
Ulgrim? What are you doing out here?
I haven't been entirely honest with you. I'm not a chef, not by profession anyway, although maybe that would have been a better path...

As it is, I'm an assassin and former First Blade of the Erulan Emperor. It's a title I've not always been proud to bear as my line of work has not always been virtuous, but I dealt with threats to the empire. Now all of humanity is threatened by foes more deadly than anything we've faced before. It is, however, a time when I can put my talents to a more noble purpose.

You haven't been entirely forthright with me either, "Taken" but don't worry, I'm the keeper of many secrets.

Why did you join me in Devil's Crossing only to leave again?
My job was to scout the countryside, get bearings on enemy strongholds and investigate weaknesses.

Your mention of people surviving out in Devil's Crossing was intriguing, so I wanted to see it for myself. Having learned everything I could about the area, I felt it was time to return to my men in Homestead.
Your men?
Can't say I like it anymore than they do, but I am working alongside the Black Legion. They are all that remain of the imperium's forces.



Seems you have things covered.



The First Blade of the Emperor?
Look, I'm sure you have many questions, but now is not the time.

We need to get these people to Homestead.



So how can I help here?
I stumbled upon these refugees on my way through Smuggler's Pass. The trolls were about ready to serve them for dinner before I intervened. Now we are stuck out here, caught in the midst of a battle between the trolls and the Aetherial wretches.

Doesn't help that the only safe way through to Homestead is now caved in. There is only one option and there is no way we are making it through there alive, well I suppose I would.I know I'm putting a lot of weight on your shoulders, but I need you to go down into the Mountain Deeps. There is a seldom traveled passage there that will spit you out onto the Prospector's Trail. Follow it until you reach the farmlands. Homestead should be not far beyond.

You must secure the path for us. It's the only way these people will survive. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold off the trolls before they come in force.
I will find a way to Homestead.
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
I've been there. I can take you there via riftgate.


So the 'Taken' has returned. Ready to lend a hand or do you still not 'trust' me?

What's the situation here?
I haven't been entirely honest with you. I'm not a chef, not by profession anyway, although maybe that would have been a better path...

You haven't been entirely forthright with me either, "Taken" but don't worry, I'm the keeper of many secrets.
What did you call me?
A 'Taken'. Well, formerly so if we get down to semantics. The Aetherial left you just before you hanged to death, am I not correct?
How do you know all this?
My sources are quite good, if I say so myself. But you trusted me, and now I shall trust you.



Not sure I can trust you anymore.

How did you know I would come here?
You seem to want to do the right thing by the people of Devil's Crossing. They're going to run out of food soon.

If I were looking for a new source, I'd head up here too.
What are you doing out here?
Why hello again, mistrusting stranger. I was wondering when you'd be coming through here. You have a knack for going where the killing is thickest.
How did you end up out here?
I haven't been entirely honest with you. I'm not a chef, not by profession anyway, although maybe that would have been a better path...

A 'Taken'. Well, formerly so if we get down to semantics. The Aetherial left you just before you hanged to death, am I not correct?
How do you know all this?
I know that you've left quite a mess back in Cronley's hideout. Not that he didn't deserve it. That man was a twisted bastard that deserved everything he got.

I also know about your heroics back in Burrwitch. Warden Krieg nearly bested one of the most powerful inquisitors I've ever met, yet you were able to overcome him.

My sources are very good, if I say so myself.
You sure know a lot about me.
It comes with the trade. But let's worry about that later. Now that you've arrived, perhaps we can finally get out of this little predicament.

I want no part in this.
I know about your heroics back in Burrwitch. Warden Krieg nearly bested one of the most powerful inquisitors I've ever met, yet you were able to overcome him.

And yet you passed through Arkovia without a second thought of Cronley's activities. Intentional? Will have to ponder that further.

My sources are very good, if I say so myself.

I know that you've had to battle through beast and Aetherial to get this far, but yet you refuse to face the world's real demons.

Now that you've arrived, perhaps we can finally get out of this little predicament.

Alright, I'm going.
