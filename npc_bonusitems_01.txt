Kory the Keeper
Well met, friend! Have I seen you before?... Perhaps we've met... on the road somewhere? Kory is my name. I'm a traveler... a trader... a keeper of the strange. There was a time when... well... no matter. I've traveled far, always in the shadows.
That's an interesting coat you are wearing...
Ah, indeed...the mark of the swashbuckler is upon it. I was an adventurer like yourself, at one time...
