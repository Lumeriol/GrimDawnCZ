Elsa
It's been too long since I've had a proper uniform. The gear I stole from Cronley's bunch stank worse than an Arkovian boar.
If your name is Elsa, then a mutual friend is looking for you.
I can only assume you mean Mornay... Idiot nearly got me killed out in Old Arkovia. Bandits got us in the night, drawn to his damned fire. They tied me up and dragged me back towards their camp, probably to share me with the rest of the gang.{^n}{^n}Shame for them they weren't very good at tying knots. I slit their throats while they slept and made off on my own.
Why didn't you return to Mornay?
Well, I thought he was dead but knowing he's back in Devil's Crossing makes me even less inclined to return. He's not a bad man but I can't stand to have him fawning all over me like a replacement for his dead wife. He believes there is some great romance between us and refuses to accept that I have no such feelings.
Should I tell him you're alive?
It might be better that he believes me dead. The last thing I need is a love sick fool pursuing me through this hellish world.
Goodbye.
Did you use to be in the army?
I've, um, had a history with the imperial forces, yes. Pissed off the wrong people, ended up being reassigned as a guard at Devil's Crossing. Guess that worked out for me, huh?

The Black Legion wasn't asking many questions though. They need everybody capable of swinging a weapon.


Goodbye.
How is working with the Black Legion?
Captain Somer runs a tight shift, but I can't blame her. Hardly enough hands to go around for all that needs doing.

Didn't see myself joining another settlement so soon, but the Legion has purpose, and I want to be there when they finally push back the enemy.


Goodbye.
Goodbye.
