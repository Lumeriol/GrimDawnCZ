Direni
Damn, maybe the cult was a better idea after all.
Direni! I trusted you. Why?
Bourbon's gotta pay, no way around that. Nothing against you, not personally, but you're about the only person standing between Devil's Crossing and Darius' gang.{^n}{^n}I take you out, Darius takes me back and Bourbon hangs. Least that was the plan. Seems I've underestimated you.
You're pathetic. I regret ever trusting you.
Burn in hell, you worthless traitor.
Damn, Darius won't be happy about this.
Aren't you from Devil's Crossing? Why did you do this?

What's your issue with Bourbon?
I was a prisoner here back when this place still served as an actual prison. When the world went down the slith hole, I stayed here with Darius and his group; it was the safest place I could think of. Clearly Bourbon thought the same when he showed up with the rest of the survivors. Things escalated quickly. I'm sure it was us who fired first, but it was them that fired the last. Those prisoners that survived were driven out and 'set free'.{^n}{^n}I hid when the fighting got ugly. Came out later looking like another refugee, so I blended in and bided my time. Perhaps I waited too long, hah...cough, cough.
You got what you deserved, Coward.
You are nothing but scum. You deserve to die.
Darius is next, scum.
