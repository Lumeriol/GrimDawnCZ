The Trials of Homestead
Blood Harvest
Find Prisoners
Captain Somer's scouts have reported back from the cultist-controlled lands to the north and the situation is worse than she even imagined. The cultists are capturing farmers and using them for their blood rituals. The Black Legion cannot risk the Cult of Ch'thon bolstering their forces with Chthonic beings. You must venture out beyond Sorrow's Bastion, to the north of Homestead, and search the cultist camps. Rescue any survivors before the cultists can use them as sacrifices.
