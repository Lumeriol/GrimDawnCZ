Manticores are vicious hunters, but their Alphas are the ones you have to watch out for. They are the ones that travel beyond the usual manticore hunting grounds, leading entire packs into new areas.{^n}{^n}We cannot allow the Manticores to spread to the areas surrounding Homestead. Eliminate the Alphas around the Jagged Waste and you will be rewarded with iron bits.
