The Chthonic Menace
Betrayal at Fort Ikon
Kill Commander
The Fort is overrun with Aetherials after the fort commander had betrayed humanity to the enemy. The Legion was able to contain the breach by collapsing the front gates, but now the way to the Necropolis is barred by several tons of stone.{^n}{^n}It will take some heavy explosives to clear it out, and the only munitions capable of doing so are within the fort armory, where the bloated mutant form of Commander Lucius has fled following the arrival of Legion reinforcements. Put down this Aetherial-Possessed traitor and recover the Heavy Explosives.


Slay Commander Lucius

Open Gate
With the traitorous commander dealt with, you must now clear the front gates so that the Black Legion can advance on the Necropolis in force. The heavy explosives left behind by Commander Lucius should suffice.
Recover the Heavy Explosives
