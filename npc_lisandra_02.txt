Lisandra
I don't think I ever had a chance to properly thank you.

You have saved us from a terrible fate.
How did you get captured?
I was out in Old Grove with a few others, foraging for food, when cultists showed up out of nowhere. They were using these...things...they were like giant walking mouths full of teeth as long as my forearm. They sniffed us out.

The unlucky ones got torn apart on the spot. About eight of us, myself included, were captured and sent to their camp to be harvested. I still have nightmares about those jaws of death.
Stay safe.
You're welcome.
I hope you never end up in a cultist camp. The things they do to their prisoners...

*Lisandra shudders*

I wouldn't wish it upon anyone.
You're safe now.
