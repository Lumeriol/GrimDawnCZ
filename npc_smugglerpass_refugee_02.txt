Like many that set out with us, I was a soldier before we retired to farm lands granted us by the empire. We knew how to fight and we fared better against the zombies than other groups we've encountered. That is, until the corrupted trolls appeared and drove us into the mountains, killing dozens of my brethren. 

Now this is all that remains and only by the valor of Ulgrim; a man who fights like a devil. I don't know where he came from but I don't think he is mortal. Even if he could hold off these monsters forever, we will soon succumb to the elements. I hope you can help him deliver us from this place of death.
I will do what I can.
