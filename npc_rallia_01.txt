Rallia
Don't mind me, just waiting to be burnt to a crisp.
Um...ok.
Don't just stand there, kill them!
Alright, alright.
Since you insist, please talk some sense into Nathaniel.{^n}{^n}Fear clouds a man's judgement. He doesn't understand what he's doing.

Here to gloat over Nathaniel's prize? Want to look me in the eye before you light the torch?{^n}{^n}I suppose it's a waste of breath to tell you that I am not a Taken?
Then what are you?
These farmers wouldn't know a Taken if it walked in on them fornicating with a goat.{^n}{^n}Look...I may have dabbled in the arcane here and there, maybe cursed a few mongrels for getting too touchy, but I am not some Aetherial's puppet.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
*Rallia stares at you, her eyes piercing through you*{^n}{^n}Perhaps because you of all people should know better than to accuse people of being Taken?
I will talk to them. (Speak to Nathaniel)
I will stop them. (Attack Nathaniel)
I can't take the chance. (Burn Her)

Sounds to me like you're guilty. (Burn Her)
Why do they think you are Taken?
These peasants see Aetherfire and immediately think it must be an Aetherial's doing.{^n}{^n}Arcanists have been wielding the Aether for centuries, but nowadays you might as well tie your own noose if you're a practitioner of the arcane.


No more lies. (Burn Her)
I don't believe you. (Burn Her)
We're not done here.
Talk some sense into this maniacs!
What's going on here?
This is all a huge misunderstanding.{^n}{^n}Just talk to Nathaniel. There's a reasonable way out of all this.
I'll see what I can do.
I'm not getting involved in this.
I'm not getting involved in this.
