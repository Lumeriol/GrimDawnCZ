These are dangerous times, traveler. The roads are not as safe as they used to be.{^n}{^n}Normally I'd welcome you to sit by our fire but you'd be better off leaving this place...
Anything you can tell me about the area?
If you're heading north, I'd be careful in the farmlands. They are overrun with Dermapterans.{^n}{^n}They get more concentrated closer to their nest, where their queen resides.{^n}{^n}If you find a large hole in the ground, I'd steer clear. 
Thank you for the warning.
Thank you.
