Devil's Crossing
The Seamstress
Collect Fabric
Constance from Devil's Crossing was a seamstress prior to the Grim Dawn. If you supply her with some fabric, she will sew blankets and canopies for the survivors. She recommended checking the Abandoned Waterfront in Burrwitch for fabric that may have been left behind when the town was abandoned.
