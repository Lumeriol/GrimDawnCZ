Jagged Waste
The Groble Tyrant
Kill Dranghoul
Bloodfeast the Ruthless is a vicious dranghoul that has driven the local grobles into a frenzy. With the dranghoul rallying them under a single banner, the grobles are becoming a serious threat to the region that cannot be ignored. If you slay Bloodfeast, then the grobles should scatter and return to their tribal groups. Bloodfeast makes his home in a nearby ruined fort known as Tyrant's Hold, to the east of Deathmark Vallar's camp in the Pine Barrens.
