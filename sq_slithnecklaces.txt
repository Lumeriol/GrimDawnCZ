Devil's Crossing
That Good Old Slith Charm
Find Slith Necklaces
Torven of the Rovers has offered to create a ring for you if you bring him the Slith Necklaces he needs to do so, along with 100 Iron Bits to compensate him for the effort. Slith shamans are known to carry primitive bone necklaces to power their magic. You can find them near slith dens, throughout Wightmire. When you have enough necklaces, return to Torven at the rover camp west of the Sodden Hollow in Wightmire.
