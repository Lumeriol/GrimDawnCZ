Bounty: Master of the Pit
Bounty
The outlaws inhabiting the Four Hills in Old Arkovia have a favorite past-time: throwing unarmed prisoners into their pit to face off against Boris.{^n}{^n}Boris is a butcher who revels in the bloodshed. It's sickening.{^n}{^n}Whenever he's about the Four Hills, he can be found in the pit near the coast.
