Mama said you might come back here.{^n}{^n}She needs to speak to you.
And where is your mama?
She said she had some important stuff to do by Malmouth. She said not to tell papa.{^n}{^n}I don't know what a Malmouth is, but it sounds gross.
I found that book and brought it back to your mama.
Good to know. Thanks.
I'll go talk to her then.
I'll go talk to her then.
Hello!{^n}{^n}Mama was talking about you. She said you like to stick your nose in books that aren't yours!
I found it and brought it back to your mama.
Oh! Well that was very nice of you.{^n}{^n}Mama writes in there all the time.
Take care, kid.

Take care, kid.
Well, it was a very important book.
Pšššt, ať ji neprobudíš.
Copak to tady máš?
Tohle je Mona. Nechala bych tě jí podržet, ale bývá mrzutá a pláče, pokud ji chová někdo jiný než já.
Chápu. Tak Monu opatruj.
Dobrá, budu potichu.
