Get us out of here!
Help is on the way.
I don't know who you are, but I don't much care. You're not a cultist. At least you don't look like one.

Please, get us out of here. Those bastards have been taking us out of the cage, one at a time. We were forced to watch while they drained a man completely of his blood. It was horrible.
I can get you all back to Homestead via riftgate.
At this point I'd settle for anything. Just get us home.
See you in Homestead. (Open Riftgate)
