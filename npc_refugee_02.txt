Marcus
I suppose things could be worse.
Goodbye.
Where did it all go wrong? One minute I'm making the trade deal of my life, the next I'm stuck out in the middle of the woods surviving on scraps!
We've all suffered in the Grim Dawn.
I don't think you understand the scope of the situation. I was going to move to the estates. The estates!
I'm...sorry.
Goodbye.
