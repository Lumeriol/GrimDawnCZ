Lay a finger on Benevald and you're a dead [[ms]man[fs]woman].
Can you tell me anything about the area?
Nothing you probably haven't seen for yourself.{^n}{^n}Darkvale's teeming with the Cult of Ch'thon and their void terrors.{^n}{^n}Fort Haron is under constant assault by either the necromancers or Kymon's zealots. Neither side holds it for long.{^n}{^n}The Asterkarn Mountains beyond Darkvale have become too dangerous for travel. If the wildlife won't get you, then the Bloodsworn will.
Thanks for the warning.
Are you guarding this man?
Benevald's earned himself a reputation for collecting rare and precious goods, so he's had his fair share of thieves and cutthroats.{^n}{^n}Nowadays, I suppose thieves are the least of our worries.
I see.
I don't want to start any trouble.
Alright.
