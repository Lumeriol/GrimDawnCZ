Jagged Waste
Pride of Jagged Waste
Kill Manticore
Deathmark Vallar is leading a Black Legion expedition out in the Pine Barrens to track down and destroy grave threats to the people of Homestead. With his people stretched thin, he has offered to pay you for the death of a manticore matriarch known as Mogara. The Jagged Waste to the southwest of Vallar's camp is a hunting ground for manticores, so he recommends that you start your search there.
Slay Mogara in the Jagged Waste

Return to Deathmark
