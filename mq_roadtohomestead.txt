The Search for Food
A Timely Arrival
Find Homestead
Ulgrim is stuck out in Deadman's Gulch with several refugees, many of them injured. He has asked you to fight your way through the Mountain Deeps, a treacherous cavern system traveled by few, in order to reach the other side of the gulch and eventually Homestead itself. Once you've made your way out of the Mountain Deeps, you should follow the Prospector's Trail northwest until you reach the farmlands. There you will find Homestead, hopefully still under the control of the Black Legion.
