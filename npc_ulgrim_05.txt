Ulgrim
Prepare yourself. The nightmare buried underneath the Necropolis is all too real.
I have some questions.
Go ahead.
You seem unusually shaken by the Loghorrean's return.
It's nothing. Just saddened to discover that such evil can never truly be contained.{^n}{^n}*Ulgrim smirks*{^n}{^n}If I get too emotional during the fighting, just hand me a handkerchief.
I have another question.
I'll keep that in mind.
You say this thing has been summoned before?
Yes, many centuries ago, at the Battle of Ikon. Nobody knows for sure whether it was the Carineans performing a last desperate maneuver, or perhaps the Loghorrean was drawn to all the spilled blood, but the results were catastrophic.{^n}{^n}And now we know what the real purpose behind the Necropolis was.
I have another question.
Mistakes of the past coming back.
What's our plan of action?
I'm preparing an elite team to infiltrate the Necropolis and take the enemy by surprise from the inside.{^n}{^n}Speak to Creed for more details when you're ready.
I have another question.
Will do.
Nevermind.
Farewell.
