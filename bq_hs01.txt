Bounty: Harvestmen
Bounty
The Aetherials twist all that is good in this world to their twisted designs. We have witnessed first-hand as they turned our scarecrows into possessed monstrosities that hunt our people.{^n}{^n}Haunted Harvesters are capable of attracting ravens that are bound to their will, somewhat ironic. We wish these abominations be destroyed and have set aside iron bits to see the task through.

Slay Haunted Harvesters

You have completed the task for Homestead and should return to the Bounty Table for your reward.
