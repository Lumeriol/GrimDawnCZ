Weapons Master Borrov
With those cannons, we'll give anything that comes within 300 yards a taste of Black Legion lead.
Perfect.
Off with ya. I've got inventory to do.
Goodbye.
You're still in one piece, suppose that means ya didn't try to enter the Conflagration then.{^n}{^n}Wise choice.
Actually, I went out there. The cannons are secured.
Well I'll be damned. Ya got more guts than brains, but ya won't find me complaining when those cannons are back in our hands.{^n}{^n}I'll have some men sent out there to haul them back immediately.{^n}{^n}Ya have done the Legion a huge service. Thank ya.
You're welcome.
You're still in one piece, suppose that means ya didn't try to enter the Conflagration then.{^n}{^n}Wise choice.
Where are the cannons?
As I said. We had to leave 'em behind up the road to the northeast when the Aetherials attacked us in force. We call that area the Conflagration now, and with good reason.{^n}{^n}The very ground will cook you alive with aetherfire. Ya like living? Stay out of that place.
Thanks for the warning.
Goodbye.
*The Weapons Master looks over the supplies and sighs*{^n}{^n}It's a damn shame about the cannons. This place would feel a whole lot safer if we had a few of those beauties mounted up on the walls.
What happened to the cannons?
We had no choice but to abandon them on the road when the Aetherials attacked us in force. Thankfully the bastards don't know a thing about artillery.
What if I recovered them?
Then I would call you insane. Treading into that area is nothing short of suicide. There's a reason we call it the Conflagration now.{^n}{^n}It's overrun with Aetherials. Even the very ground will cook you alive with aetherfire. Ya like living? Stay out of that place.
Just watch me.
You're right, it sounds like suicide.
Then call me insane because I've already secured those cannons.
Well I'll be damned. Ya got more guts than brains, but ya won't find me complaining when those cannons are back in our hands.{^n}{^n}I'll have some men sent out there to haul them back immediately.{^n}{^n}Ya have done the Legion a huge service. Thank ya.
You're welcome.
Goodbye.
Off with ya. I've got inventory to do.
Goodbye.
