Bounty: Vizier Haxin
Bounty
Dermapteran Viziers are the prime of the queen's spawn. Whenever one is selected to ascend as one of her Grand Viziers, it is called back into the hive to feast until it grows to monstrous size.{^n}{^n}One such Dermapteran, Vizier Haxin, appears to be next. If it is killed before it reaches the final stage of its metamorphosis, then the Dermapterans will lose a valuable guardian. Search the fields for this monstrosity, before it becomes a problem too big to handle.{^n}{^n}Scavenged materials have been set aside as a reward for accomplishing this brave deed.
