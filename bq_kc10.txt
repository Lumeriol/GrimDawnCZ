Bounty

The Chosen of Ch'thon willingly give their bodies to the void, allowing its most powerful fiends to cross over into Cairn without the use of a riftgate.{^n}{^n}One such Chosen, by the name Thullon, has been spotted making the rounds at Cult's camps. This is an opportunity, brothers and sisters. One that we cannot miss.{^n}{^n}Thullon's elimination will be amply rewarded with materials from our stores.
