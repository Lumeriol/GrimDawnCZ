Homestead
Lumber for the Legion
Claim Lumber Mill
Homestead is running low on building supplies, particularly lumber, but there are still many repairs that require attention. Sergeant Serriv of the Black Legion has pointed out that there is an abandoned lumber mill in the Blood Grove. However, it is overrun with Chthonic spawn. She has asked Captain Somer for assistance in this matter, but the Captain believes the casualties would be too great for too little gain; but you are not under the Captain's command. If you clear out the lumber mill in the Blood Grove, then the Black Legion can send in guards to keep it secure. To enter the Blood Grove, head north out of Homestead.
