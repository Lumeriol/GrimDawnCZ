Oscar Jr.
You're really brave! Someday I want to be brave like you.
How are you holding up?
I miss dad...{^n}{^n}*Oscar looks ready to cry, but then lifts his head with resolve.*{^n}{^n}But I have to be brave, for Judith.
Just listen to what Constance tells you.
That's a good kid.
Take care.
Cronley was scary. Thank you for bringing us here.
You're welcome.
Dad said I should look out for Judith. So I will!

Good idea. Take care now.
Please! Let us out! Cronley said he's going to... expe... experama... do bad things to us!
Ok. I'm going to open a rift.
That sounds scary. Are you sure?
You'll be safe on the other side. Promise. (Open Riftgate)
I'll be right back.
I saw you at the village! You made Silas go away! Please, let us out!


I'll be right back.
I saw you at the village! You made Silas go away! Please, let us out!
How did you get here?
Bad men came after you left the village. They...{^n}{^n}*Oscar starts to cry*{^n}{^n}They killed everyone, even dad, then set everything on fire! Please, you have to help us!


I'll be right back.
