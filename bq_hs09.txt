Bounty: The Marrowdrinker
Bounty
Terror tales have been told of trolls breaking into homes in the night and stealing young virgins, but no tales were as horrid as that of Bogloth the Marrowdrinker.{^n}{^n}Bogloth would not bother with just virgins, he would leave entire households in shambles, the inhabitants slain and their bones ripped from their bodies.{^n}{^n}There have been recent sightings of Bogloth near Smuggler's Pass, likely his hideout. Put that monster down and we will see that you are rewarded with some of our scavenged supplies.



Slay Bogloth

Turn In
You have completed the task for Homestead and should return to the Bounty Table for your reward.
