Soulkeeper Kaandris
Lead us to greatness, [[ms]brother[fs]sister].
Farewell.
You have done the Order a great service.
What of Malkadarr?
He shall resume his duties under the Keeper of Tomes, his knowledge preserved for future generations.
Farewell.
You're welcome.
You should not be here.
Alright, I'm leaving.
Everything is in place.{^n}{^n}The ritual will require my complete attention, so it falls on you to keep the dead contained while I search for Malkadarr. I will be shielded from their presence, but should any of the spirits remain when the ritual is finished, the results could be disastrous.{^n}{^n}Are you ready to begin? 
What do I have to do?
The ritual will draw spirits to itself like a beacon in the darkness. Make sure that whatever comes through the veil is not around for long.{^n}{^n}You must keep the room clear so that it is Malkadarr we bring back, and not some wayward soul.
I am ready. (Begin Ritual)
I'm not ready to begin yet.
I am ready. (Begin Ritual)
I'm not ready to begin yet.
You should not be here.
Alright, I'm leaving.
