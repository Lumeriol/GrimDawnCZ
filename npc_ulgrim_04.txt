Answer 3
I have another question.

Nevermind.

Still haven't talked to the Captain?
Where is she?
Right here in Homestead. Look for the grumpy middle-aged hag in Black Legion armor.
Ok.
I'll speak to her soon.
I suggest you speak to Captain Somer. She is the Black Legion officer in charge of this sorry bunch.

She will fill you in on the situation.
I will speak to her.
Maybe later.
I wasn't sure you'd make it, but you pulled through.

These people owe you their lives.
I did what was right.
I wish that was the end of our troubles, but there is a grave threat on the horizon that threatens to destroy us all if we don't act soon.
What do we do now?

Come back another time. I've got important matters to attend to.
Farewell.
