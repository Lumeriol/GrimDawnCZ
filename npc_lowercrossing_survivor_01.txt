Faldis
We're all going to die out here.
Help is on the way.
We're all going to die out here.
Calm down, where are you from?
I was staying with a group of survivors down in Devil's Crossing, you know...the old prison, but supplies started running low. I volunteered to go scavenging around Lower Crossing. Figured it was safe enough, but I was wrong.{^n}{^n}I got chased in here by a pack of ravenous rift scourges, though I can't hear their maddening skittering anymore. I suppose I have you to thank for that?{^n}{^n}It doesn't matter though. The area is overrun with the dead. We won't make it five feet without getting surrounded.
The way back should be clear now.
I'm not going back out there again.{^n}{^n}The dead will find us and tear us apart.
Well, I suppose I could open a riftgate.
Fine, you're on your own.
I suppose I could open a riftgate.
A what? Isn't that what those...those things are pouring out of?
Well, sort of, but mine will take you home.
I'm having a hard time believing that after what I've seen up in Burrwitch.{^n}{^n}But you don't seem to have the look of a 'Taken' about you. I suppose this is my only option.
See you back at Devil's Crossing. (Open Riftgate)
Forget it. Find your own way home.
Nevermind.
You're on your own.
You're on your own.
