If you're looking for wares, speak to my father.
Farewell.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
I try to do what's best.
Hello, my father's told me about you. It's not every day you meet someone friendly and understanding out there in the wilds.
Your father seems like a good man.
He's always looking out for me, especially now that mom's passed on.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Pleased to meet you.
I've heard about you. You extorted my father for money out on the road. People like you don't deserve to be here.
I just did what I thought was right.
That so? If you're so sure, then give us back what you stole.
Very well, here. (Give 1000 Iron Bits)
Oh, well um, I wasn't expecting you to actually give it back.

Thank you.
Consider it a misunderstanding.
Very well, here. (Give 4000 Iron Bits)
Oh, well um, I wasn't expecting you to actually give it back.

Thank you.
Consider it a misunderstanding.
Very well, here. (Give 9000 Iron Bits)
Oh, well um, I wasn't expecting you to actually give it back.

Thank you.
Consider it a misunderstanding.
Sorry, I can't do that.
Figured you for scum. Just leave us alone.
Goodbye.
Hm, I'm afraid I don't have it anymore.
Your father stole from Drew.
Is that what that slimy slith told you?

Drew tried to rape me in my sleep and my father defended me from him!

I'm sorry, perhaps there was a misunderstanding.
Goodbye.
Hello. My father's still setting up shop. You should speak to him if you need to buy something.
Farewell.
