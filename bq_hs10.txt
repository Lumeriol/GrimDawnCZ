Bounty
The Dermapterans have overrun our fields. They feast on months of back-breaking labor. But there is one among them more ravenous than any Dermapteran we had ever seen.{^n}{^n}We call it the Locust, and it is a massive weavil. Normally, Dermapterans molt well before reaching such a size. We dread to think what he will turn into.{^n}{^n}Better to kill it before it transforms. A reward of scavenged materials to anyone that braves the Dermapteran Hives.
