Inquisitor Creed
If you have something to say, make it quick.

Goodbye.
I'm pleased that you will join us. It may take everything we have to stop the cult.
Where are we headed again?
The Black Legion has a stronghold to the north.
I'm on my way.
We will stop them.
We are not going to be in Homestead much longer, and I could use your help.

Will you join us?
Where do you need me?
WORDS
I will meet you up north.
I'm afraid I can't.
I have some matters I must attend to first.
You're here. Good.

We have much to discuss.
I found these notes on Karroz.
Hm, I've heard of this ritual. It has been performed only once before, if my memory serves me. The results were...not good.

We cannot waste any time. We must head north to STRONGHOLD immediately. Will you join us?
Where do you need me?

A timely rescue. The fate awaiting those prisoners was indeed a horrible one.

Farewell.
You have done well in destroying that abomination. I dread to think what it could have done should it have been set loose.

Farewell.
I hear you are headed to the Gruesome Harvest. Be mindful of the possessed trolls. They are even stronger than their living counterparts and highly resistant to the Aether. The Vanguards can even unleash the Aether in a burst of energy around them.

The Reanimators will resurrect additional allies if not dealt with quickly, but if you manage to destroy them, their minions will fall along with them.
How do you know so much about the Aetherials?
I've dedicated all my resource to tracking down the Aetherial threat, but I was too late to stop the events that led to the Grim Dawn.

Now I study the enemy, learn their tactics so that we make no further mistakes. Trust me, I fully intend to use every resource at our disposal.
Well, thank you.

Thanks for the tips.
If you have something to say, make it quick.
I have some questions.
You may ask.
How do you know Ulgrim?
I've first had the pleasure of meeting Ulgrim back in Erulan, during a convergence of the high court. I was there on Inquisition business, he was doing what he does best.

The unease with which people conversed around him immediately drew my attention. Of course, back then he was known by a rather unusual title: the First Blade of the Emperor.
The First Blade of the Emperor?
Yes, the emperor's personal spy and executioner. His name was stricken from all the records. His very identity erased so he could exist outside the boundaries of the law.

This gave the emperor great freedom in handling matters some would deem objectionable to the crown. All knew it, none would dare bring it to light lest they have a meeting with the First Blade.
I have another question.
The court sounded like a treacherous place.
I have another question.
I see.
How did you escape from Warden Krieg's lab?
Ah, that was a little trick of the trade. As an inquisitor, I have access to many occult artifacts and relics that the Office of the Inquisiton has deemed benign. I use them to great advantage.

Krieg underestimated that.
Could I have access to some of these?
These aren't toys we just hand out to everybody. They are powerful artifacts that have to be handled carefully.

I'm afraid the answer is no.
I have another question.
Very well.
I have another question.
Farewell.
What does an inquisitor do?
The Office of the Inquisition was responsible for tracking down and crippling occult activities within the empire. That could mean anything from preventing the dissemination of heretical texts to locking down a dangerous artifact.

The Cult of Ch'thon was our greatest challenge and, given their recent rise to power, our greatest failure.
I have another question.
Farewell.
Actually, nevermind.
Farewell.
